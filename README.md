## Daily Exercises App - Flutter UI

There are two pages, you can call it home page and details or meditation page. On the home page at the top right corner you got a menu button, then a big good morning for you. After that a search bar with a rounded corner, then a list of exercises for you. Lastly, at the bottom you got a Button navigation bar.

Now come to the details or meditation page, Top of the page has a title with a short description of the course and on the right side a yoga lady vector with a small search bar.
